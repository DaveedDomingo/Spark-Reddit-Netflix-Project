# MapReduce-Reddit-Project
Getting started with MapReduce by Analyzing Reddit Data on AWS

In this project, students will explore the distributed computing approach of MapReduce by counting the number of times a Reddit post was upvoted given Reddit Data.

Read the full project description in ProjectDescription.pdf

Guides on how to run MapReduce on AWS and at Rutgers' Hadoop cluster can be read in MapReduceOnAWS.pdf and MapReduceAtRutgers.pdf respectively

The Reddit Data sets to be used in this project can be found in the "Reddit Data" folder.

Reddit data was taken and modified from Stanford's SNAP data sets:
https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Reddit.html

### For Instructors
The latex version for the project writeup is included within the latex folder if you wish to modify it for your particular class. 

This project can be utilized to  explore the following topics: 
- Concepts: Map Reduce, AWS, HDFS
- Languages: Java
- Frameworks: MapReduce, Hadoop

To make it easier for students, its recommended to compress the "Reddit Data" folder for easier project distribution.
